#### Usage

There are two kinds of coordinate axes: `xAxis` and `yAxis`, which vary according to the specific `Plot`.

<b>There are two ways to configure axes: </b>

Method 1, pass in 'Boolean' to set whether to display a legend.

```ts
xAxis: false; // hide xAxis
```

Method 2, pass in _AxisCfg_ to configure the axis as a whole.

```ts
xAxis: {
  text: 'title of xAxis'
}
```
